# scoped-store-todo-demo-wod
A to-do implementation using ScopedStore without TypeScript and decorations.

If you want see another to-do implementation using TypeScript and decorations, 
please check [scoped-store-todo-demo-wod](https://github.com/sungjin70/scoped-store-todo-demo) repository.

To show how to use ScopedStore, this demonstration does not use props, provider/injects, and VueX, which are the basic state-sharing methods provided by Vue.

Through this demonstration, I hope you get some ideas of using ScopedStore in practice.
